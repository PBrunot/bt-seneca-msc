# bt-seneca-msc project

A pure Javascript API for the Seneca Multi Smart Calibrator device, using web bluetooth.

It has minimal dependencies (one logger packages), implements modbus RTU FC3/FC16 functions and has been tested with a Seneca MSC device with firmware 1.0.44 ; tested on PC/Windows with Chrome and Edge. Source is Node.js but the distribution versions are CommonJS (browserified with a standalone MSC object).

A sample application is available here: https://pbrunot.github.io/bt-seneca-msc/

## How to build

* Install Node.js 
* Checkout the repository
* Run from your command line:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run dist
    npm run dev
```

## How to use in your application

* For Node.js applications :

```bash
npm install bt-seneca-msc
```

* For ASPNET.core :

```powershell
libman install bt-seneca-msc --provider jsdelivr
```

## External API

There are 4 operations available:

```js
await MSC.Pair(); // bool - Pair to bluetooth
await MSC.Stop(); // bool - Disconnect the bluetooth and stops the polling
await MSC.Execute(MSC.Command); // bool - Execute command. If the device is not paired, an attempt will be made.
await MSC.GetState(); // array - Get the current state
```

### Connecting to the meter

* Call MSC.Pair() while handling a user gesture in the browser (i.e. button-click)

```js
 var result = await MSC.Pair(); // true when connection has been established
```

* A dialog will be shown to the user of devices with bluetooth name beginning with MSC
* After pairing, the required bluetooth interfaces for Modbus RTU read and write will be established.
* In case of communication errors after pairing, attempts will be made to reestablish bluetooth interfaces automatically.

### Getting the current state of the meter

* Behind the API, there is a state machine running every 750 ms. 
* If there is no command pending from API, read requests will be done to refresh the state at this frequency.
* When the meter is measuring, measurement and error flag are refreshed at this rate (see: btState.lastMeasure). 
* When the meter is generating, setpoint and error flag is read (see: btState.lastSetpoint).

```js

var mstate = await MSC.GetState();
mstate.status         // State machine internal status (Ready,Busy,Pairing,...)
mstate.lastSetpoint   // Last executed generation function. Element at position 0 is the setpoint.
mstate.lastMeasure    // Last measurement. Element at position 0 is the main measurement.
mstate.deviceName     // Name of the bluetooth device paired
mstate.deviceSerial   // Serial number of the MSC device
mstate.deviceMode     // Current mode of the MSC device (see CommandType values)
mstate.stats          // Generic statistics, useful for debugging only.
mstate.ready          // The meter is ready to execute commands
mstate.initializing   // The meter is initializing bluetooth
mstate.batteryLevel   // Internal battery level in Volts
```

* Internal states reference

The state property returned by GetState() can have the following values (see MSC.State enum)

| Constant | Value | Meaning | Next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
 NOT_CONNECTED     | 'Not connected'                     | Initial state (before Pair())        | CONNECTING
 CONNECTING        | 'Bluetooth device pairing...'       | Waiting for pairing to complete      | DEVICE_PAIRED
 DEVICE_PAIRED     | 'Device paired'                     | Pairing completed, no BT interface   | SUBSCRIBING
 SUBSCRIBING       | 'Bluetooth interfaces connecting...'| Waiting for BT interfaces            | METER_INIT
 IDLE | 'Idle' | Ready to execute commands            | BUSY
 BUSY              | 'Busy'                              | Executing command or refreshing data | IDLE,ERROR
 ERROR             | 'Error'                             | An exception has occured (BT or data)| METER_INIT
 STOPPING          | 'Closing BT interfaces...'          | Processing Stop request from UI      | STOPPED
 STOPPED           | 'Stopped'                           | Everything has stopped               | -
 METER_INIT        | 'Meter connected'                   | State after SUBSCRIBING              | METER_INITIALIZING
 METER_INITIALIZING| 'Reading meter state...'            | State after METER_INIT (reading data)| IDLE

### Sending commands to the meter

The MSC device supports readings and generations. Each function corresponds to a CommandType enum value.
Generations require one or more setpoint, depending on the specific function.

In all cases, the workflow is the same.

* Read example

```js
var command = new MSC.Command(MSC.CommandType.mV); // Read mV
var result = await MSC.Execute(command);
if (result.error) {
    // Something happened with command execution (device off, comm error...)
    return;
}
var measure = await MSC.GetState().lastMeasure;
if (measure.error) {
    // Measure is not valid ; should retry 
}
else {
    console.log(measure); // Print the measurements
}
```

* Generation example

```js
var command = new MSC.Command(MSC.CommandType.GEN_V, 5.2); // Generate 5.2 V
var result = await MSC.Execute(command);
if (result.error) {
    // Something happened with command execution (device off, comm error...)
    return;
}
var sp = MSC.GetState().lastSetpoint;
if (sp.error) {
    // Generation has error (e.g. short circuit, wrong connections...) 
}
else {
    console.log(sp); // Print the setpoint
}

```

* If another command is pending execution, Execute() will wait until completion.

* If the state machine is stopped, an attempt will be made to start the machine.

* API will try to re-execute the command if communication breaks during execution (see internal states above).

* The API will put the device in OFF state before writing setpoints (for safety), then apply the new mode settings after a slight delay.

* For specific functions (mV/V/mA/Pulses), a statistics reset command will be sent to the meter 1s after mode change.

* To get the expected setpoints for a specific command type, use Command.defaultSetpoint(). This is used in the demo page in order to present to the user the right input boxes with meaningful descriptions.

```js
// Create a temporary command
const command = new MSC.Command(ctype);
// Get the default setpoint for this command type
const setpoints = command.defaultSetpoint();
// Inspect setpoints array to get information about units, setpoint required...
const howmany = Object.keys(setpoints).length;
```

## Branches & development info

* Pushes to main will trigger GitHub actions for CI and NPM package update. If the package.json has a new version respect to NPM repository, it will be published automatically. Also, pushes to main branch update the Github pages with the sample application.
* Most development shall happen in development branch, then PR to main once ready.
* Testing is difficult without a real device due to the bluetooth interface. Only basic API tests are covered by JEST package. To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

* The CommonJS files can be generated in two ways, minified ("dist") or normal ("dev") :

```bash
npm run dev
npm run dist 
```
